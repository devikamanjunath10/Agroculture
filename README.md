   Inventory: Admin can add, update, or delete records for farming supplies, tools, or harvested goods.
   Transactions: Admin can manage and track sales, purchases, and financial records.
3]User Roles:
The project supports different user roles:

5]Backend Integration:
All records (inventory, transactions, etc.) are stored in an SQL Server database.PHP scripts handle database interactions through embedded SQL queries for data retrieval, insertion, updating, and deletion.
6]Execution:
The project requires a virtual server like XAMPP installed on the userâ€™s PC to run.XAMPP sets up an Apache server and MySQL database, enabling the system to function locally.
